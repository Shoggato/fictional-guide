    <h1>9.1 -Introduction to SQL</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br>
    <p>This lesson will introduce you to one of the most popular programming languages for working with databases: SQL. 
        SQL programmers are in high demand, so this language is important to learn. The lesson will begin with a brief overview of SQL. 
        Then, you’ll complete a series of exercises that consist of using SQL to create both tables and simple queries.</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Run Postgres and pgAdmin.</li>
        <li>Create a SQL database and its tables by using pgAdmin.</li>
        <li>Define SQL data types, primary keys, and unique values.</li>
        <li>Load the data from CSV files into a database and then query the data.</li>
        <li>Explain the four basic functions of persistent storage—create, read, update, delete (CRUD)—and apply them to a database.</li>
        <lie>Combine the data from multiple tables by using JOIN clauses.</lie>
    </ul>
