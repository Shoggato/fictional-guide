    <h1>15.1 -Data Visualization with Leaflet</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br>
    <p>In this lesson, you’ll learn to create data visualizations with maps. 
        First, your instructor will lead a brief demonstration of creating a Leaflet map. 
        Next, you’ll have the opportunity to create your own map using Leaflet and complete a brief labeling exercise. 
        Then the class will transition to a discussion of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) shapes to use as markers such as points, circles, polygons, polylines and rectangles. 
        With these new skills under your belt, you’ll complete two more advanced activities: a visualization of the world GDP per capita, and enhancement to your existing US Cities map to include populations for the states and cities.
         Finally, the class will end with an introduction to working with GeoJSON data and an activity in which you will plot the occurrences of earthquakes</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain the benefits of visualizing data with maps.</li>
        <li>Create maps and plot data with the Leaflet.js library.</li>
        <li>Parse data from the GeoJSON format to create map-based data visualizations.</li>
        <li>Describe the concepts of layers and layer controls and how they are applied to add interactivity to maps.</li>
    </ul>
