    <h1>Working With Weather And City APIs</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br>
    <p>Today’s lesson will expand your API querying capabilities by introducing you to a variety of new APIs. 
        The class will begin with a short review activity, where you will traverse a JSON file using your knowledge of Python. 
        Then, after you’ve warmed up, you will work with the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides developers with various meteorological data.</p><br>
    <p>Later in the lesson, you will learn about exception handling, which can be helpful when databases and API requests have missing values. 
        Finally, the lesson will conclude with a few activities to help you build familiarity with API usage and reading complex documentation.</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Create applications with your knowledge of Python and an API’s documentation.</li>
        <li>Load JSON from API responses into a Pandas DataFrame.</li>
        <li>Use try-except blocks to handle errors.</li>
    </ul>
