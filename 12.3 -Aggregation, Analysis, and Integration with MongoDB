    <p><strong>12.3 -Aggregation, Analysis, and Integration with MongoDB</strong></p><br>
    <p>In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to create aggregation pipelines to assist with performing analysis on documents in a Mongo database. 
        The lesson will begin with a class warm-up activity where you will import the data you will use for the whole lesson. 
        Then, you'll be introduced to aggregation functionality and aggregation pipelines with PyMongo. 
        Finally, during the second half of the class, you will work in groups on a mini-project to bring together the Mongo skills you have developed and integrate them with APIs, Pandas, and Matplotlib.</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Use aggregation and aggregation pipelines with MongoDB to analyze a subset of a MongoDB collection.</li>
        <li>Convert a MongoDB result to a Pandas DataFrame.</li>
        <li>Import data from an API to save to MongoDB.</li>
        <li>Use data from a Mongo database to plot charts with Matplotlib.</li>
    </ul>
