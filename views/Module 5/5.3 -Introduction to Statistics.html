    <h1>Introduction to Statistics</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br>
    <p>Today's lesson combines your knowledge of fundamental statistics with Matplotlib and SciPy. 
        After a brief review of summary statistics, you will learn how to implement these statistical measures by using Python. 
        Then, once youâ€™re comfortable with basic statistics in Python, you will learn a few new statistical concepts and models that you can use in your projects. 
        These include sample versus population, standard error, Pearson correlation coefficients, and linear regression.</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, by using Python.</li>
        <li>Plot, characterize, and quantify a normally distributed dataset with Python.</li>
        <li>Qualitatively and quantitatively identify potential outliers in a dataset.</li>
        <li>Differentiate between a sample and a population with respect to a dataset.</li>
        <li>Define and quantify correlation between two factors.</li>
        <li>Calculate and plot a linear regression with Python.</li>
    </ul>
