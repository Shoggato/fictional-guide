    <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br>
    <p>Welcome to programming with Python! The first portion of the lesson will focus on command line basics. 
        These basics will help you use more advanced CLI tools later in this module as well as future modules in the course. 
        You will use the command line to access files and folders and to update GitHub repositories.  
        You’ll also use the Python interpreter to write and run Python scripts.</p><br>
    <p>Then, you’ll make sure that Python and Anaconda are correctly installed on your computer. 
        At the end of the lesson, you will learn some basic programming functionality, including variables, conditionals, and loops.</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm that Python 3 is correctly installed</li>
        <li>Navigate to folders on your computer by using the command line.</li>
        <li>Create Python scripts and run them in the terminal.</li>
        <li>Perform basic programming tasks by using conditional statements and lists.</li>
    </ul>
