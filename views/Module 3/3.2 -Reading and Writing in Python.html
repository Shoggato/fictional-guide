    <h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
    <p>Todayâ€™s lesson will focus on how to iterate over lists in Python. The lesson begins with a recap of how to use loops in Python. 
        Then, after a more advanced looping activity, you will take your Python programming skills to the next level by learning how to read data from and write data to external CSV files. 
        The lesson will conclude with an introduction to functions, which are reusable code blocks that are essential to efficient programming in Python.
