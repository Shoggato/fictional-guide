    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br>
    <p>In this lesson, you will learn how to add custom interactivity to your web visualizations. 
        First, youâ€™ll be introduced to basic document object model (DOM) selection, manipulation, and events using D3.jsLinks to an external site., an industry-standard data visualization library written in JavaScript. 
        The lesson will begin with an overview of D3 and D3.json from your instructor. Then, the lesson will turn to D3 Select and append. 
        After a brief overview from your instructor, you will complete an activity using D3 to add a new row of data to a table. 
        Then, after a walkthrough and activity using the this keyword, class will finish with a demonstration and activity on how to create dropdown menus by using Plotly.</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Create charts by using data from API calls.</li>
        <li>Use D3 for basic document object model (DOM) manipulation and event handling.</li>
