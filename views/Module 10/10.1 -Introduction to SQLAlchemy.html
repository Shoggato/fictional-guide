    <h1>10.1 -Introduction to SQLAlchemy</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p><br>
    <p>This lesson will combine what we learned last week about SQL with our favorite programming language: Python. Before getting started, you’ll need to install SQLite. 
        SQLite is a SQL dialect that shares much of its syntax with PostgreSQL, but it’s entirely serverless.
        The lesson will first introduce you to SQLAlchemy, a Python library that’s designed to work with SQL databases. 
        You’ll then complete an activity in which you’ll analyze weather data by using SQLAlchemy. 
        After another activity in which you’ll create new DataFrames based on United States census data, your instructor will lead you through a crash course in object-oriented programming (OOP).</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Connect to a SQL database by using SQLAlchemy.</li>
        <li>Perform basic SQL queries by using engine.execute().</li>
        <li>Create Python classes and objects.</li>
        <li>Perform create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on data in a SQL database by using the SQLAlchemy object-relational mapper (ORM).</li>
    </ul>
