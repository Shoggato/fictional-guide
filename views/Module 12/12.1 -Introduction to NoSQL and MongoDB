    <p><strong>12.1 -Introduction to NoSQL and MongoDB</strong></p><br>
    <p>In this lesson, you’ll learn about NoSQL databases with a focus on MongoDB. 
        MongoDB is a document database that has more flexibility than a structured database, like a SQL database, for storing data. 
        It can handle both smaller, personal projects and larger-scale projects that a company might require. 
        For this module, MongoDB is a better choice than SQL because you'll use data that is stored in JSON files, which is very similar to the Mongo BSON format.</p><br>
    <p>The lesson will begin with an overview of NoSQL databases and how they differ from SQL databases. 
        Then, your instructor will lead you through an activity about working with basic MongoDB queries using the Mongo shell. 
        Once you feel comfortable creating elements in a Mongo database, you’ll learn how to update and delete data. Finally, you’ll learn how to import CSV and JSON files into a Mongo database from your Terminal.</p><br>
    <p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p><br>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases to aid decisions around what kind of database to use in different situations.</li>
        <li>Create and connect to local Mongo databases.</li>
        <li>Perform create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on Mongo documents by using the Mongo shell.</li>
        <li>Import data from CSV and JSON files into a local MongoDB database.</li>
    </ul>
