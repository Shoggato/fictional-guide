    <h1>Module 3</h1>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong><br> This week, you will transition from VBA to programming with Python. 
        First, you’ll learn about the basics of the command-line interface, or CLI, which is used to work with the files and folders on your computer. 
        Although it will take some time to get used to, the command line, also called the terminal, can be faster and more effective than your operating system's graphical user interface (GUI). 
        You'll get plenty of exposure to the command line throughout the course.</p><br>
    <p> Once you’ve explored the command line, you’ll install Python and begin to explore some basic functionality like variables, conditionals, and loops. 
        Next, you will turn your attention to learning how to read from and write to CSV files with Python. 
        Finally, you’ll expand your Python knowledge by using dictionaries and lists. 
        There’s a lot to cover, so let’s get started!</p><br>
